Introduction
This project showcases the creation of various components using HTML and CSS, along with an integration of XML data to enhance the content dynamically. The goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in front-end web development and data integration techniques.

Components
Form
The form.html file in the form directory contains an example of a stylized HTML form. This form demonstrates how to structure input fields, labels, and buttons using CSS to create an engaging user interface.

Table
The table.html file in the table directory showcases the creation of an aesthetically pleasing HTML table using CSS. This example highlights the arrangement of table rows and columns to present tabular data effectively.

Frame
In the frame directory, you will find the frame.html file, which illustrates the creation of a framed element using CSS. This component exemplifies how to use CSS styles to create visually appealing frames around content.

XML Integration
The data.xml file contains sample XML data that can be dynamically integrated into the components. This integration is designed to showcase how XML data can be utilized to populate content within the HTML components.

Usage
To explore and use the components in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/priyanshusharma44/HTML-CSS

Open the form.html, table.html, and frame.html files in a web browser to see the respective components in action.
